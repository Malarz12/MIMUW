# Stock exchange simulation

This app was developed as an assigment during OOP couse as a part of the Computer Science Bachelor's Studies at the Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Mechanics, University of Warsaw.
In this project the main goal is simulating stock market system and investors.

## Overview
### How to run simulation
- download everything from this folder
- compile the project (with Intelij for example)
- run main with two parameters: path_to_input_file number_of_rounds

### Inputs
Inputs template (text in angle brackets describes subsequent data, while text in parentheses describes their types):

```
<investors: each R lub S>
<stock companies <name>: <starting price>>
<investor's wallet: <funds> <stocks <name>: <count>>
```
For example inputs given in the original task can be found in src.

### Types of investors
*RANDOM* - An investor making random investment decisions (implement any strategy, e.g., random order type for buy/sell, random company, random number of shares, random price limit). The randomization occurs according to the specified conditions.

*SMA* - An investor making decisions based on technical analysis of individual stocks using the Simple Moving Average (SMA n) - the arithmetic mean of prices over the last n rounds (in our task, we use n=5 and n=10). The price in a given round is taken as the price of the last transaction for that stock, which occurred in one of the previous rounds (if there were no transactions for several rounds, the stock price remains unchanged). A buy signal occurs when the longer average - SMA 10 crosses from below the shorter average - SMA 5, while a sell signal occurs when SMA 5 crosses from above SMA 10.

### Output
The simulation will print the final state of the portfolio for each investor after completing all rounds of the simulation as well as some other stats.

## Project was based on this book.
